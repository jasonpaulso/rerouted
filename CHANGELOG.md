# Changelog

All notable changes to ReRouted are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Release tags use the form `vX.Y.Z` and match `package.json`. GitHub Releases carry the installable artifacts; this file is the durable narrative for humans and agents.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.10] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- Antigravity Flash and Pro streaming responses now accept Google's CRLF-delimited SSE frames instead of completing with empty output.
- Claude Code's canonical Fable and Claude Opus 4.8 model IDs now resolve through matching `fable` and `opus-4.8` named routes, preserving configured cross-provider fallback.
- Anthropic overload responses now create short model-scoped transient cooldowns instead of misleading quota-wide account locks.

## [0.5.9] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed

- Long-running streamed responses now send protocol-safe keepalives so clients such as Claude Code do not cancel healthy requests during extended model silence.

## [0.5.8] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed

- Reasoning models no longer fail with a synthetic 408 and temporary account lock when Claude thinking or Responses reasoning is the first streamed output.

## [0.5.7] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- Routes now select Provider, then Model instead of exposing individual accounts. ReRouted tries all eligible accounts for that provider/model before advancing to the next fallback or round-robin member.
- Existing standard-provider route members migrate to provider/model destinations; custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints remain connection-specific.

## [0.5.6] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- Opening a route now replaces the routes list with a full editor instead of burying an edit panel below the grid with no scroll.
- Removed the laggy route-card lift animation so clicks feel immediate.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- Back navigation throughout onboarding with in-progress form and route state preserved.
- All On and All Off controls for every connected account's model list.
- Direct API-key links for OpenRouter and NVIDIA NIM connection forms.

### Changed

- Reworked Routes into a compact card grid with whole-card editing and a focused editor.
- Added drag-and-drop route-member ordering alongside the existing accessible arrow controls.
- Removed onboarding credential autodetection and its renderer, dashboard, CLI, and IPC paths.
- Formalized project governance, release lifecycle, PR/release note expectations, and repository hygiene (branch cleanup, merge defaults, maintainer docs).

## [0.5.4] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- Classify thrown context failures so they do not poison OAuth account pools.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- Pre-output stream inspection pass-through and related streaming edge cases.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- Bound pre-output stream inspection so inspection cannot hang the request path.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- Route exhaust / fallback until a usable upstream response is obtained.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- Headless Linux CLI and local web dashboard (`rerouted`, `/dashboard/`).
- Linux npm-compatible release tarball on stable GitHub Releases.

### Changed

- Product positioning covers macOS menu bar and Linux headless control plane.

## [0.4.18] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- Anthropic Messages compatibility (`/v1/messages`, token count, Claude Code path quirks).
- Explicit adaptive thinking support for Claude adaptive requests.

### Fixed

- Tool-use cycles and provider translation edge cases for Claude Code workflows.
